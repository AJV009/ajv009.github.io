#### Acquisition Story
Acquired during a hunting trip to local retailers in early 2022. Found at a Target store during one of my regular collecting rounds. The premium series often has limited distribution, making finds like this particularly satisfying.

#### Display Strategy
Currently displayed in a protective case alongside other Premium muscle cars:

Collecting Hot Wheels goes beyond mere accumulation - it's about preserving automotive culture in miniature form. Each model represents design history, manufacturing evolution, and the enduring appeal of cars in popular culture. This Dodge Charger exemplifies these values while showcasing the craft of modern diecast production.
