The CPU (Central Processing Unit) - "The brain of the computer" - has been at the center of one of technology's most intense rivalries for decades.

(Following is a little article I wrote up back in 2018 for my college magazine. Yes it had lots of mistakes, but I intend to keep it as is because it would be fun to read this later and hey in todays world where everything is heavily moderated using AI tools, its good to have some raw unedited content too. hehe.)

## CPU: The Heart of Every Computing Device

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)** - well, everyone knows it's the brain of the computer. There are tons of CPU manufacturers on this earth, each specializing in different computing segments:

### Microcomputer Processors
For small microcomputers, we have **ARM CPUs** with famous manufacturers like:
- **Intel** - x86-based mobile processors
- **Broadcom** - System-on-chip solutions

### Traditional Computer Processors
Traditional computers use **x32, x64, x86 architecture** processors manufactured by both **Intel and AMD** (both locked in tough competition).

### Mobile Processors
For smartphones, some of the best include:
- **Apple A12X Bionic** - Apple's flagship mobile chip
- **HiSilicon Kirin** - Huawei's in-house processors
- **Samsung Exynos** - Samsung's mobile processors
- **Qualcomm Snapdragon** - Industry-leading mobile chips
- **MediaTek Helio** - Budget-friendly mobile processors

## The Traditional Computer CPU Wars

Every generation brings a really tough competition between **Intel and AMD**. When Intel first started with their CPUs, they were always the fastest. After a generation or two, AMD started their own league of really great processors.

### The Epic Battle Lines
It's been a war between:
- **Intel's Core and Xeon** vs **AMD's Ryzen and Threadripper**

This war continues with Intel releasing both cheap and expensive CPUs every six months, while AMD responds with their own innovations.

## The Gaming Revolution: AMD's Rise

AMD had a huge impact when **gamers started falling in love** with the cheap, speedy **AMD Ryzen processors**. However, on the developer side, AMD never provided those epic Intel technologies in their CPUs, so the developer community stayed with Intel CPUs for a long time.

### Intel's Strategic Response

Since the number of gamers far exceeds developers, Intel thought they could capture more gamers by partnering with AMD to create their **8th generation Core processors**. These processors featured **integrated AMD-powered graphics**.

From one perspective, it worked - we could actually play **GTA 5 at minimum settings** using these higher-core CPUs. However, there were many diehard Intel fans (myself included - I actually disliked the whole AMD segment of GPUs and CPUs at the time) who hated the idea of adding AMD graphics to Intel processors.

### Market Success Despite Controversy

This idea seemed destined for failure, but Intel then:
- **Dropped prices significantly**
- **Reduced base core speeds**
- **Flooded the laptop market** with these 8th gen CPUs

The strategy worked because people could play their favorite games on laptops without discrete graphics cards at lower prices.

## The 9th Generation Revolution

Then came the special **9th generation Intel CPUs**, which controversially **removed the Hyper-Threading feature** - perhaps Intel felt their CPUs were fast enough without it.

### Flagship Processors
- **i9-9900KF** - Currently the best available in the market
- **Intel Core i9-9990XE** (rumored) - Said to come with good speeds, extra cores, and overall awesomeness

These **i9 9th gen CPUs** changed how people decided to buy processors - they became the choice for both developers and gamers.

## Understanding Intel's Naming Convention

Intel uses different post-fix letters to categorize their CPUs:

- **U/M** - Low power, Mobile Performance
- **K** - Unlocked Multiplier for Overclockers
- **X** - Extreme, Unlocked
- **XE** - Extreme Edition, Unlocked
- **F** - Graphics-less (no integrated graphics)
- **G** - Better high-performance integrated graphics

## AMD's Counter-Attack

The bigger gaming community's friendship with AMD, having competition with both **Nvidia over GPUs** and **Intel over CPUs**, gave them a direct challenge. AMD responded by bringing:

- **New AMD 3rd gen Ryzen processors** - Said to be faster and more efficient than Intel's latest offerings
- **AMD Radeon VII GPU** - Competing directly with RTX graphics

This cycle continues with both AMD and Intel producing dozens of new CPUs every year.

## Personal Preferences and Combinations

For me, **Intel and Nvidia always win**. Intel recently released their **i3 9th gen F CPU** and Nvidia released affordable **RTX 2060 3GB GDDR6 GPUs**. It's an awesome budget combination!

For extreme performance, we could build something incredible with:
**Intel i9-9990XE + Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000**

## The Enthusiast Dilemma

Computer geeks and enthusiasts are **never happy** with the speeds they get from even the latest, most powerful CPUs. There's always a desire for more performance, more cores, and higher clock speeds.

## India's Indigenous CPU Development: Project Shakti

Did you know that **India is developing its own CPU** codenamed **Shakti**? Here's the fascinating story:

### Development Journey
1. **Prototype Phase**: India received a prototyped Shakti from Intel with **22nm** manufacturing process
2. **Manufacturing Reality**: When India started manufacturing it domestically, the size increased to **120nm** - significantly larger than the prototype
3. **Parallel Processing**: India also started working on **Para-Shakti** (not paranormal shakti!) - it's **Parallel Shakti**, essentially stacking one Shakti processor over another

*Personal note: They should have called it "Double-Shakti!" ðŸ˜„*

## The Future of CPU Wars

The CPU wars show no signs of slowing down. With each generation, we see:
- **Increased core counts**
- **Better power efficiency**
- **Enhanced integrated graphics**
- **Specialized instructions for AI and machine learning**
- **Advanced manufacturing processes** (7nm, 5nm, and beyond)

### Emerging Trends
- **AI acceleration** built into CPUs
- **ARM processors** entering the laptop and server markets
- **Custom silicon** by major tech companies
- **Quantum processing** research and development

## Conclusion

The CPU wars between Intel and AMD have driven incredible innovation in computing performance. Whether you're a gamer seeking high frame rates, a developer requiring powerful processing, or an enthusiast wanting cutting-edge performance, this competition ensures we all benefit from better, faster, and more efficient processors.

The battle continues, and frankly, we're all winners in this war of innovation.
