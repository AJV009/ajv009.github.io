In our hyper-connected digital world, "Data Security" has become "a really important factor" that affects every aspect of our lives, from personal privacy to national security.

(Following is a little article I wrote up back in 2018 for my college magazine. Yes it had lots of mistakes, but I intend to keep it as is because it would be fun to read this later and hey in todays world where everything is heavily moderated using AI tools, its good to have some raw unedited content too. hehe.)

## The Massive Scale of Data Collection

Every industry working on **Artificial Intelligence** and improving user experience is on the path of collecting **massive amounts of data** about users of their products. But how much data are we talking about?

### Real-World Examples

**Google Assistant** in our phones collects our daily usage patterns to provide a more personalized experience. **Android 9.0 Pie** analyzes our daily usage patterns to optimize CPU task scheduling according to user preference levels.

Even **Microsoft Windows 10** explicitly mentions data collection in their User Agreement - though many users didn't bother reading it and later tried to file cases against Microsoft claiming illegal data collection.

### The Data Collection Race

Nearly **½ of the apps** on Windows, Android, and iOS App Stores collect user information. There's an ongoing race between tech giants about **who collects more data** - and the one with more data is always the winner.

**By 2025, every second a user will create 2.2 GB of data.** This includes:
- Images and videos
- Documents and files
- Social media messages (Facebook, etc.)
- Data from wearables
- Information from connected IoT devices
- Bank details and sensitive documents stored on government servers

## The Data Privacy Dilemma

Imagine if one day your digital personal assistant starts calling you by your pet name and conducts business transactions without asking for your bank details. The convenience is undeniable, but isn't that also **creepy**?

### A Disturbing Scenario

Here's a thought-provoking scenario: A man calls a pizza place to order food, saying he'll pay on delivery. The pizza shop responds that they can't trust that arrangement because:

- The caller took a loan last month
- His health records show he's been taking medication
- His financial situation suggests he might not be able to pay

**The man only made a phone call**, but the pizza center:
1. Collected his phone number
2. Analyzed his voice for identification
3. Fetched comprehensive details about him
4. Determined it wasn't safe to deliver based on his health and financial status

During this conversation, the caller was completely shocked that the pizza shop knew every detail about his life. **This is our approaching reality** - soon, anyone with internet access could potentially fetch anyone's information.

### The "God's Eye" Reality

Remember the **God's Eye** from Fast and Furious? This fictional device could find information about every person living by hacking into every database and camera on Earth, providing accurate results about anyone you searched for, including identifying everyone captured in traffic cameras.

**This will soon become reality.** That sounds scary sometimes, doesn't it?

## The Dark Side: Cyber Criminals

There are thousands of **cyber criminals** who could potentially harm someone without physical contact - just using their personal data. They can:

- Track your location at any time
- Access your device remotely
- Control your cameras and microphones

### Real Security Vulnerabilities

Scientists have demonstrated the ability to **track a smartphone accurately in New York even when GPS was switched off**. Unknown apps on your phone could activate your cameras and stream footage live to someone else's computer.

### Personal Security Experiment

I conducted a small experiment by integrating a payload into the popular game **PUBG's APK**. The antivirus couldn't detect it, but I could:
- Read messages
- Send texts
- Make calls
- Watch through cameras
- Control the device completely
- Even restart the phone remotely

*This demonstrates how vulnerable our devices can be to sophisticated attacks.*

## Data Security: A Long-Living Career

**The only job that will exist as long as someone cares about their data is Data Security.** It's really that important.

### Real-World Success Story

A few years back, a **second-year Computer Engineering student** challenged SBI bank, claiming he could hack their current security system. The bank offered him a **cash prize of ₹2,00,000** to prove it.

**He succeeded** - he hacked into their security system. Then he was asked to find a solution. Subsequently, he was contacted by many other banks to:
- Find security loopholes
- Develop solutions for vulnerabilities
- Strengthen their cybersecurity infrastructure

### The Growing Demand

In the near future, you'll find **2-4 Data Security experts in every bank**. This shows how valuable data security has become.

### Why Data Security is Critical

Every year, someone hacks into major tech companies' servers and leaks **terabytes of confidential information**. It would be a nightmare if someone knew what you did during last year's vacation better than you do.

## The Permanent Career Choice

If someone wants a job they can stay in for a long time, **Data Security** is the answer. While many other fantastic technologies come and go over the years, the need for data protection will only grow.

### Future Outlook

The demand for cybersecurity professionals will continue to expand because:
- **Data generation is exponentially increasing**
- **Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated**
- **Digital transformation** is accelerating across all industries
- **Regulatory compliance** requirements are strengthening globally
- **IoT devices** are creating new attack surfaces

## Protecting Ourselves in the Digital Age

As individuals, we must:

1. **Read privacy policies** and terms of service
2. **Use strong, unique passwords** for each account
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** wherever possible
4. **Regularly update** our devices and applications
5. **Be cautious** about app permissions
6. **Monitor our digital footprint** regularly

## The Bottom Line

Data security isn't just about protecting information - it's about **protecting our freedom, privacy, and digital rights**. As our lives become increasingly digital, the importance of robust data security measures cannot be overstated.

The question isn't whether we need better data security - it's how quickly we can implement it before the threats outpace our defenses.
