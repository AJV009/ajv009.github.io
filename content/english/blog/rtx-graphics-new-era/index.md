(Following is a little article I wrote up back in 2018 for my college blog. Yes it has mistakes, but I intended to keep it as is because it reflects my bad english writing style of that time. hehe.)

The new era of RTX Graphics has arrived, and "They say it's important, so get one if you can." But what makes these graphics cards so revolutionary?

## An Epic Costly Graphics Card: Do You Really Need One?

"Do you really need to buy one?" Well, it depends if you got gaming in your blood OR you're going towards Machine Learning or Deep Learning. A graphics card is really important if you are a sort of gamer. Games have a lot of post-screen and real-time rendering frames per second. Creating such a sophisticated environment using integrated graphics is a really demanding task - it's just too much stress for the CPU to even create average graphics on the screen without dropping those important frame rates.

As for developers, a GPU is extremely important. Its number of cores are used to do complicated mathematical operations. Implementing large Neural Networks and working on large datasets running through them needs a lot of memory that is really fast.

## The GPU War: Nvidia vs AMD

Didn't you get confused while looking over the variety of GPUs offered by both GPU manufacturers? Sometimes it felt like buying an AMD graphics card over the overpriced Nvidia was always a better option. Well, NO - it's not like that. AMD always had their graphics cards focused on gamers, while Nvidia tried to balance both gaming and Deep Learning requirements in the same GPU.

So gamers can rejoice with the new latest AMD Radeon VII GPU with nearly the same performance given by the new latest Nvidia 2080 Ti GPU at half the price. But it's a whole different story for developers, as Nvidia GPUs are supported by many developer tools and you can also find a large community using them.

## Nvidia: Going from Famous GTX to New RTX

There was a decade of really famous Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics. In GTX, the GT stands for Giga-Texel and maybe the X stands for Extreme or something similar. Some of the famous GPUs still bought by the common person are the GTX 710 2GB and GTX 1050 Ti 4GB. A whole new variety was started in 2018: The Epic RTX - Real Time Ray Tracing.

## Nvidia RTX Graphics Technology

The RTX graphics are built on the new Nvidia Turing Architecture. The RTX GPUs also bring some new technologies with them: **DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling)** and **Ray Tracing**.

**Ray Tracing** - is the holy grail of gaming graphics, simulating the physical behavior of light to bring real-time, cinematic-quality rendering to even the most visually intense games like never before.

**DLSS** - Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is new RTX technology that uses the power of deep learning and AI to train the GPU to render crisp images, while running up to 2x faster than previous generation GPUs using conventional anti-aliasing techniques.

## Advantages of Using RTX Technology

- Real-Time Ray Tracing
- Factory Overclocked Founders Edition
- Incredible performance with Ray Tracing
- Artificial Intelligence Aided Games
- Ray Tracing makes High Core Counts Relevant

## Gaming on RTX GPUs

Now just imagine finally gaming on a 4K display at 144Hz, having really high FPS and graphics that look as if you were watching a real movie or you were just in the game. With those awesome Ray-Tracing tech and AI-featured games, it's just damn **AWESOME**.

## Development on Latest RTX GPUs

Because of having a totally new improved architecture, these RTX GPUs have an extra number of CUDA Cores and Tensor Cores. So implementing larger Neural Networks would be easier than doing it on older GTX graphics. This RTX tech is a bit futuristic - many more games and APIs are yet to come.
