    content: "Alphons is a uniquely exceptional software engineer. His passion for technology in general, and his ability to learn anything new in that space in a remarkably small period of time always amazed me! You ask Alphons if he knows something, it's rare that he doesn't. And if he doesn't, it's not for long! The amazing things he did at QED42 was nothing short of genius! He once did a POC that integrated AI search to a Drupal website; And for a programmer with just under 3 years of experience, he came out of that with a product that looked like it was built by a team of highly experienced Senior Developers. It was just a pleasure listening to him speak about it. Alphons proves every day that experience is not calculated in years, but in the volume and variety of things you accomplish in those years. I can honestly say a year of work experience for Alphons should be considered as at least two! \n\n And you can't simply ask Alphons something about technology. :) Be prepared to learn almost everything about what you just asked him. He will write you an essay that will paint a very detailed and elaborate picture of what you just asked him. This also extends to the reports (performance analysis, incident analysis, bug reports etc) he creates as well. Any company would be lucky to have him. I wish him all the best."
