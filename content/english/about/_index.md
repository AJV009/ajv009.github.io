Am a passionate GenAI Engineer and Full Stack Developer. My journey in technology is driven by an insatiable curiosity and the belief that "Learning and building is my hobby!"

### Who Am I?

I'm currently working as a **GenAI Engineer at Etherwise** and proud **Co-founder of HugrLabs**, where we explore innovative tech solutions at the intersection of BioTech, AI, Quantum Computing, and Security. What fascinates me most is the sweet spot between these domains - particularly the potential for consciousness cloning and transfer technologies.

As an **INTP-T (Logician)** personality type, I'm naturally drawn to flexible thinking and enjoy taking unconventional approaches to solve complex problems. This mindset has shaped my career from my early days as an intern to my current role leading GenAI initiatives.

### My Journey

My professional journey began with internships at QED42, Kode IT Solutions, and Tablabs, which laid the foundation for my career. I progressed through roles at QED42, from Associate Engineer to GenAI Engineer, before venturing into the exciting world of GenAI at Etherwise and co-founding HugrLabs.

I hold a **Diploma in Computer Technology** from Government Polytechnic Ahmednagar with an 88% aggregate and First Class with Distinction. My academic excellence combined with practical experience has enabled me to work on diverse projects ranging from AI-enhanced search engines to healthcare chatbots.

### What Drives Me

I'm deeply passionate about:
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems
- **BioTech Applications**: Leveraging AI for healthcare innovations and biological research
- **Quantum Computing**: Exploring the next frontier of computational possibilities
- **Security Research**: Developing advanced threat detection systems
- **Open Source**: Contributing to community projects and knowledge sharing

### Beyond Technology

When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me:
- **Speed Cubing**: Sharpening problem-solving skills and pattern recognition
- **Playing Chess**: Developing strategic thinking and tactical planning
- **Cycling & Swimming**: Maintaining physical fitness and mental clarity
- **Reading**: Diving into science fiction and technical literature
- **Traveling**: Exploring new cultures and gaining fresh perspectives

### Let's Connect!

I'm always open to collaboration opportunities and interesting conversations about technology, innovation, and the future. Whether you're interested in discussing AI ethics, quantum algorithms, or just want to chat about the latest tech trends, I'd love to connect!
